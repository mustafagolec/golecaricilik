This website contains orange and blue color palette. Orange for connotation of honey and used in main parts of site, blue for Beekeeping side of the site. The style of the site is a little bit different than usual. I decided make it different for making it unique.
Also English language support will be added very soon!

# User Interface

The interface is filled with a lot of animations, gradient background and handpicked colors for keep the user from getting bored and making the site look better.

You can create your own account or login to existing one. Currently everyone who logins will be counted as admin. But this will be fixed in future updates.

You can't comment without logging in but unfortunately you can delete the dynamic comments without logging in. This will be fixed too.

With this section, users will be informed about unwritten rules of beekeeping. I did chose blue tones because I thought it will look more scientific and better for reading.

# With the next update;
o Editing products and categories <br />
o Filtering products with categories <br />
o Comment deleting crisis will be fixed <br />
o Authentication (admins and user will be seperated) <br />
o Commenting on products (Currently only main page) <br />
and more...
